Noisy Classification for MNIST dependent annotators

# Data Simulator (Morphological Transformations)
We generate synthetic annotations from original MNIST dataset, for which there is known GT labels which we do not use for training. We simulate 3 annotations, namely good-segmentation (which is similar to original images), thin, and thick using [Morpho-MNIST software](https://github.com/dccastro/Morpho-MNIST). The original MNIST dataset and its annotations can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19e2KVY0A-44fnsGUu--3I1n8vXtInvJw/view?usp=drive_link).
